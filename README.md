# British_Airline_Sentiment_Analysis

### Description 
Analyze customer sentiment and satisfaction patterns in airline reviews through automated data collection and sentiment analysis techniques.

### Business Introduction
British Airways plc (BA) is the flag carrier of the United Kingdom, headquartered in London near its main hub at Heathrow Airport, formed in April 1974 through the merger of British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA). The company primarily operates international and domestic air travel services, offering passenger and cargo transportation, aircraft maintenance, ground handling services, and holiday packages, while being associated with the oneworld alliance to enhance its worldwide reach. As a global airline with over 100 years of heritage, British Airways connects people, places and diverse cultures across an extensive network spanning Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia and Australia

### Business Problem Statement
British Airways, as the UK's flag carrier operating extensive international and domestic routes through its Heathrow hub, faces the challenge of monitoring customer satisfaction across its vast network while competing in an increasingly demanding aviation market. With thousands of passenger reviews generated daily across multiple platforms, BA lacks the systematic capability to analyze this critical feedback at scale, missing opportunities to identify service gaps, route-specific issues, and emerging customer concerns that could impact its premium brand reputation and market position. This inability to harness customer sentiment data effectively puts the airline at a competitive disadvantage, preventing proactive service improvements and limiting its ability to maintain the high service standards expected from a global flag carrier with over 100 years of aviation heritage.
